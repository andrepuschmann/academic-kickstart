abstract: D2D-communication is a novel concept for data transmission between mobile users in vicinity. Besides the potential of providing very high data rate and low power communication, this technique can also be used to increase the capacity of a mobile network by means of, e. g., offloading some of the traffic from the network. The present paper discusses the application of D2D-communication to delay critical services, which can hardly be supported over infrastructure based networks. Within this context, we options and requirements for resource control are indicated and some ways for improving especially the sharing of the resources between cellular and D2D-users are shown. Moreover, first insights into the simulation of D2D-communication using open-source software and some early results are provided.
