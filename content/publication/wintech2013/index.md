abstract: "Software Defined Radio (SDR) is a technology which facilitates experimentation and the practical realization of novel
wireless communication systems. Especially low-cost SDRs,
however, experience high communication delays due to the
connection between the radio hardware and the host computer. This delay hinders the implementation of Medium
Access Control (MAC) protocols. In Carrier Sense Multiple
Access (CSMA) based protocols, especially the Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) as well as the subsequent channel
access phase are subject to strict temporal constraints. In
this paper, we present two strategies that address both issues and aim to enhance the performance and efficiency of
CSMA protocols implemented on low-cost SDRs. The first
approach employs a dedicated spectrum sensing engine as
a CCA agent for the SDR. The second strategy optimizes
the frame transmission path inside the SDR. Experimental
results indicate that both strategies have a positive impact
on reducing the slot time parameter of the CSMA MAC."
