abstract: "In this paper, we present a prototype Cognitive
Radio (CR) ad-hoc network exploiting available radio spectrum
opportunities while ensuring primary user protection. We present
a flexible link-layer protocol that consists of a channel-hoppingbased rendezvous component, a CSMA-based MAC protocol and
a coordinator-based spectrum mobility block. We also show
a prototype implementation of a database-driven knowledge
aggregation component called Resource Map which assists the
CR network in its channel selection process. The demonstration
shows a video stream originating from one CR node destined to
another over the Primary User (PU) radio spectrum band. The
demonstration also shows a cognitive channel selection process
(instead of random free channel selection) where the CR network
quantifies the radio channels based on the observed PU activity
and reduces the overall channel handover count. These features
are observable through a visualization of the spectrum sensing
and aggregation process."
