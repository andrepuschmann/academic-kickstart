abstract: "We design, implement and evaluate a load-adaptive MAC
protocol based on a flexible, component-based link layer architecture. We first present the overall architecture that
facilitates a generic data transfer protocol used by ordinary user applications and management functions of the link
layer, called link layer apps. Based on this architecture, we
propose a load-adaptive MAC protocol for fixed spectrum
networks that is designed as a link layer app on top of the
data transfer protocol. The protocol reuses existing MAC
blocks and allows switching between those based on run-time
analysis of the wireless communication system performance.
Finally, we evaluate a SDR implementation of the entire
system through various experiments."
