I am a 4G/5G full-stack radio access network engineer. I am a srsLTE
core developer and also the current project maintainer.

I am the VP Engineering in Software Radio Systems, the company behind srsLTE. I am coordinating
the commercial 5G activities and lead the C-V2X development.

Prior to that, I was working as a  postdoctoral researcher
at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland and Ilmenau University of Technology, Germany.
