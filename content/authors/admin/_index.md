I am a 4G/5G full-stack radio access network engineer. I am a <a href="https://www.srslte.com/" target="_blank">srsLTE</a>
core developer and also the project maintainer.

I am the VP of Engineering in <a href="https://www.softwareradiosystems.com/" target="_blank">Software Radio Systems</a> (SRS), the company behind srsLTE.
Within SRS, I am leading the Layer 2/3 activities and look after all aspects of product quality assurance.

Over the past years, I've worked on various 4G/5G related projects, both as active developer, leading engineer
and/or project manager. 

Prior to helping to build srsLTE, I was working as a postdoctoral researcher
at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland and Ilmenau University of Technology, Germany.

I am involved in open-source software development for more than 15 years.
